In simple case like 2-SAT we can use algorithm from this paper:

A LINEAR-TIME ALGORITHM FOR TESTING THE TRUTH OF CERTAIN QUANTIFIED BOOLEAN FORMULAS

Alternative algorithm:
Iterate over all variables and check if u and ~u are in different SCCs.
Iterate over all variables, mark a component whenever you encounter an existential variable, and check whenever you see a universal variable.
Iterate over all components in reverse topological order and keep track of components, from which you can reach a universal vertex.
If there is a component with at least two universal vertices, or a component with a universal vertex, from which another universal
vertex is reachable, then the formula is false.
